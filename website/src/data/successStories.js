        Most of us are familiar with having the prospect of having to grind tons
        of Leetcode problems before the interview, but I really wanted a sense
        of direction, an outline of sorts to prepare efficiently; I wanted to
        pick questions that covered all the important concepts one can be tested
        on. The Tech Interview Handbook provides just that; the Algorithms
        section was an absolutely invaluable resource and a great overall
        reference to brush up my fundamentals with the helpful hints and tips
        provided, and also solve some of the most popular questions categorized
        by type. I certainly have Yangshun to thank for helping me land my dream
        job at Google!

        The Tech Interview Handbook played a crucial role in the success of my
        previous job search. The contents are carefully curated and well
        organized. It served as an excellent roadmap for my interview prep.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to the thorough Data Structures and Algorithms section, the
        handbook also provides a lot of resources on other aspects of the
        application process that helped me see the tech interviews in a more
        holistic way. My favorite non-technical part was "Questions To Ask"! I
        used quite a few insightful questions from there to challenge and
        impress my interviewers. The results were great!
        <br />
        <br />
        With the help of Tech Interview Handbook, I was able to land offers from
        Google, Amazon, Uber and several other great companies. Really
        appreciate Yangshun and other contributors for putting out such quality
        content for the community. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this handbook to
        anyone!

        I always thought that getting a job at Facebook was a dream beyond my
        reach. However, with help from this handbook, determination and
        preparation, my job hunt went beyond my expectations and was pretty
        successful, landing me offers with Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Dropbox,
        and Lyft. Huge thanks to the authors for sharing their knowledge!
