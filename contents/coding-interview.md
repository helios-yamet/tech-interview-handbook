Coding interviews are tough. But fortunately, there's a tried and proven method to get better at them. With a combination of studying, practicing questions and doing mock interviews, getting that dream job can become a reality.

We recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all path to interviewing success, it is largely dependent on the individual. Here's how I recommend navigating the content of this book depending on your background for the following group of people:

- [New to coding interviews - typically college freshmen/sophomores/bootcamp grads](#newbie)
- [Passed interviews before - typically college juniors/seniors](#returning)
- [Worked in the industry](#experienced)

## New to coding interviews {#newbie}

_Recommended for college freshmen/sophomores/juniors looking for their first internship or bootcamp graduates looking for their first job._

If you are new to coding interviews (e.g. first time interviewing for an internship/full-time job), we recommend reading through the entire section from start to finish.

1. Decide on a [programming language](./picking-a-language.md)
1. Study and revise
   - Revise your [Computer Science fundamentals](./study-and-practice.md)
   - Go over the [algorithm tips](./algorithms/introduction.md)
   - Take [online courses](./best-coding-interview-courses.md) if you need more materials
1. Practice solving algorithm questions
   - Do the [best practice questions](./best-practice-questions.md)
1. Know how coding interviews are like
   - Internalize the [Do's and Don'ts of interviews](./cheatsheet.md)
   - Know what [signals and behaviors](./coding-signals.md) interviewers are looking out for
1. Do [mock interviews](./mock-interviews.md)
1. Interview successfully to get the job

## Passed interviews before {#returning}

_Recommended for college juniors/seniors looking for their second internship or first full-time job._

You have successfully passed coding interviews before and it is not your first time job hunting. You are somewhat familiar with technical interviewing but have not interviewed in a while. It would still be good to go through most of the content in the handbook but use your own discretion and accelerate/skip portions you are familiar with.

1. Study and revise
   - Revise your [Computer Science fundamentals](./study-and-practice.md)
   - Go over the [algorithm tips](./algorithms/introduction.md)
   - Take [online courses](./best-coding-interview-courses.md) if you need more materials
1. Practice solving algorithm questions
   - Do the [best practice questions](./best-practice-questions.md)
1. Know how coding interviews are like
   - Internalize the [Do's and Don'ts of interviews](./cheatsheet.md)
   - Know what [signals and behaviors](./coding-signals.md) interviewers are looking out for
1. Do [mock interviews](./mock-interviews.md)
1. Interview successfully to get the job
1. [Negotiate](./negotiation.md) the offer!
1. Check out tips on [choosing between different offers from companies](./choosing-between-companies.md)

## Mid-level/senior candidates {#experienced}

_Recommended for people who have been working in the industry for at least a few years._

You have been working for a few years now and are a little rusty with the less common data structures and algorithms taught back in school because you don't get to use them very often at work.

1. Revise a bit of [Computer Science fundamentals](./study-and-practice.md)
   - Take [online courses](./best-coding-interview-courses.md) if you have lost access to your college materials
1. Practice efficiently via the [best practice questions](./best-practice-questions.md)
1. Do [mock interviews](./mock-interviews.md)
1. Interview successfully to get the job
1. [Negotiate](./negotiation.md) the offer!
