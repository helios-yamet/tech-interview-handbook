Have you ever encountered mysteriously never getting shortlisted for positions at certain companies despite having strong relevant experience in your resume?

This guide helps you prevent that and improve your chances of getting shortlisted for software engineering jobs.

From my experience as a FAANG interviewer as well as my discussions with countless recruiters, I have collated a very concise, no-bullshit summary of the exact steps you need to prepare your resume for a FAANG software engineering job application.

## Four steps to create your resume

1. Set up your [ATS-proof resume template](./ats-proof-template.md)
1. Fill up your template with effective [resume content](./write-effective-content.md) following a recommended format
1. [Optimize your resume](./optimize-resume.md) with keywords
1. [Review your resume](./free-tools-to-review-resume.md) using free tools

To maximize your chances of being shortlisted, I recommend getting your resume reviewed by [FAANG Tech Leads - a team of ex-FAANG hiring managers](https://www.faangtechleads.com?utm_source=techinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=resume_guide&aff=1e80c401fe7e2). I personally used their service during my applications and it helped me get shortlisted at multiple Bay Area FAANG companies (and more). It is currently **70% off as part of a limited time promotion**.
