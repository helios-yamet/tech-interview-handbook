I recommend using all of these free tools to optimize your resume:

### Free resume review by professional resume writers

TopResume provides a [free all-in-one review](https://tidd.ly/3GxVIs9) of your resume - where their professional resume writers will provide feedback on your style and organization, writing and mechanics, as well as a free ATS readability analysis, where you can view a sample output of how an industry-standard ATS would interpret your experience and skills. Highly recommended to try this out!

### Test readability with industry-standard ATS

Test the readability of your resume by an industry-standard ATS (Lever) using this [free resume parser tool](https://resume-parser.vercel.app/). Companies that use Lever for job apps include: Figma, Palantir, Netflix, Twitch, Yelp and several others.

### The plain text file test

Simply copy the content from your resume and paste it into a plain text document! Make edits if:

- There are points missing from your original resume
- Characters are displaying incorrectly in plain text
- Sections are disorganized
