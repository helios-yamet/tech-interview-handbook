I recommend using these free tools to optimize your resume:

## 1. Free resume review

[Resume Worded](https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/29828/144522?link=1861) uses AI to give instant expert feedback on your resume.

We previously recommended [TopResume's free all-in-one review](https://tidd.ly/3GxVIs9) of your resume, but received some feedback that that their reviewers are not technical and do not give feedback relevant to engineering roles. In that regard, we recommend [FAANG Tech Leads' Resume Review service (paid)](https://www.faangtechleads.com?utm_source=techinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ats_template&aff=1e80c401fe7e2) where your resume will be reviewed by ex-FAANG hiring managers and engineers, not random writers who don't understand technology.

## 2. Test readability with industry-standard ATS

Test the readability and formatting of your resume using . Most big companies use such resume scanners.

## 3. The plain text file test

Simply copy the content from your resume and paste it into a plain text document! Make edits if:

- There are points missing from your original resume
- Characters are displaying incorrectly in plain text
- Sections are disorganized
