Most companies these days automate their resume screening process through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). 75% of resumes sent to top companies are never seen by human eyes. Always ensure your resume is easily readable by an ATS to maximize job opportunities throughout your career.

## Use Microsoft Word or Google Docs to create and edit your resume

**Do's**

- Submit your resume as a PDF file to preserve formatting, but always create it from Microsoft Word or Google Docs. It is important to ensure that the text in your resume is easily highlightable, which is a precondition for easy parsing.
- ATS tools are always trying to improve their readability of standard resume formats - hence the more commonplace your resume format is, the better.
- To maximize space on your resume, rather than using header or footers, reduce the margins of the page.

**Don'ts**

- Do not use Photoshop, other graphic design tools or online resume builders to build your resume
- Try not to use multi-column formats
- Do not use the header or footer sections in a Word/Google Docs file

:::tip Expert tip

Use the standard resume template provided by Microsoft Word or Google Docs. I personally use Google Docs to create my resume as I can easily share it with peers for getting feedback and it has the convenience of being stored in the cloud.

## Use a standard font of readable size

New fonts may convert letters into special characters which are not readable by the ATS. Fonts you should use - Arial, Calibri, Garamond, Helvetica, Roboto.

Ensure your font size remains readable for humans later on in the hiring process - nothing less than the minimum size of **11px** for readability.

## Use sections with standard headings and ordering

ATS readers need to identify and parse standard types of information from your resume. Using standard header titles and ordering can help them do that better.

This is the order which has worked well for me and recommended by recruiters:

| Section | Heading Name |
| --- | --- |
| Contact information | (No need for section heading) |
| Professional summary | (Use resume headline as section title, for e.g. "Senior Software Engineer at Google with over 5 years experience leading teams") |
| Skills - programming languages, frameworks, etc. | "Skills" |
| Experience | "Work Experience" |
| Education (Note: if you are still in school, put Education first) | "Education" |
| Projects | "Projects" |
| Other optional sections - e.g. Certifications, Awards, etc | "Awards and Accolades" / "Certifications" / "Awards, Accolades and Certifications" |

:::caution

Never add symbols to your headers to avoid ATS readability issues.
