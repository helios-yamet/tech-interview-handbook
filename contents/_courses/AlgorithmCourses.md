- [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=x23W) - This course essentially expands upon the questions on this page but approaches the practicing from a questions pattern perspective rather than data structures, which is an approach I also agree with for learning and have personally used to get better at algorithmic problems. The course allows you to practice in Java, Python, C++, JavaScript and also provides sample solutions in those languages. **Learn and understand patterns, not memorize answers!**
- [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://fxo.co/DQpY) - This Udemy bestseller is one of the highest-rated interview preparation course (4.6 stars, 21.5k ratings, 135k students) and packs **19 hours** worth of contents into it. Like Tech Interview Handbook, it goes beyond coding interviews and covers resume, non-technical interviews, negotiations. It's an all-in-one package! Note that JavaScript is being used for the coding demos.
